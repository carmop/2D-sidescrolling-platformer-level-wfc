# Carmop-WFC_AnxietyCurves_SuperMarioBros

### Description

An attempt to implement anxiety curves into wave function collapse level generation in order to 
end up with an algorithm that can create pseudo-random levels based on desired difficulty.

- Wave function collapse:
	A generation algorithm which uses pre-set rules or rules inferred from a valid input to 
	generate similar permutations of the input.
	
- Anxiety Curves:
	The qualitative curve that describes a player's challenge in traversing a video game 
	level (in this case a 2D platforming level)

The idea behind combining both concepts is to create a easy to use level generator that accounts 
for intended difficulty

### Set up

This project runs on the GODOT game engine (specifically version 4.0.4).
To download and run the code first install GODOT:
	- GODOT Website: https://godotengine.org/
	- GODOT version archive (for downloading the 4.0.4 version specifically): https://godotengine.org/download/archive/
